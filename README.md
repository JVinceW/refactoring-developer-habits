# Refactoring developer habits

Presented at the [LSCC Talks - June 2016](http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/events/231798303/), see [Refactoring developer habits slides](http://www.slideshare.net/neomatrix369/refactoring-developer-habits-62785350) and [recording](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8388-refactoring-developer-habits).

See how the original list of habits got shaped into, at [TDD Good Habits manifesto](02-outcome-of-collation/tdd-manifesto/tdd-good-habits-manifesto.md) and who the [Contributors](02-outcome-of-collation/tdd-manifesto/contributors.md) behind it were.
